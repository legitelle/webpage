            <h1 class="logo">My name is Elle!</h1>
            <p>This page is dedicated to explaining how amazingly sucky I am. I grew up in a math and science based family, my father being a nuclear physicist. It didn't surprise anyone when I said that I wanted to get into something with computers and cyber development.</p>
            <h2>Robotics</h2>
            <p>My programming career started when I was a Junior in high school and joined the robotics team. I didn't understand most of it but it was still fun and interesting. I had always had a love for computers and this club really influenced my decision to pursue programming and web development.</p>
            <h3>Schooling</h3>
            <p>I went to Aquinas High School for my Freshman and Sophomore years of high school. During my Sophomore year I did an independent study with another student that focused on coding. I finished up my high school career at North Augusta High School where I continued coding on the robotics team. I studied Computer Science and Cyber Security at Augusta University for a year.</p>
